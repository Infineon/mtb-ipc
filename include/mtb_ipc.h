/**
 * \addtogroup group_mtb_ipc IPC (Inter-Processor Communication)
 * \ingroup group_ipc
 * \{
 * High level interface for communicating between processors on a multi-core device.
 *
 * The IPC driver allows communication between multiple CPUs or between multiple tasks
 * operating in different domains within a single CPU. It supports binary semaphores
 * and message queues, similar to how they are used for task interactions in an RTOS envrionment.
 *
 * \section subsection_ipc_features Features
 * * Binary semaphore for resource access control and general signalling
 * * Message queue for passing data between tasks/cores
 *
 * \section subsection_ipc_quickstart Quick Start
 * To initialize the driver, call the mtb_ipc_init on the first task/CPU to boot and
 * mtb_ipc_get_handle
 * on other cores. Please see your device documentation to determine which core to start on.
 * This will setup shared memory and the binary semaphore for protecting internal
 * functionality.
 *
 * For binary semaphores, only one task/CPU may initialize ( \ref mtb_ipc_semaphore_init) a
 * semaphore.
 * Other tasks/CPUs
 * then get the handle ( \ref mtb_ipc_semaphore_get_handle) of the created semaphore. Then take/give
 * the
 * semaphore
 * ( \ref  mtb_ipc_semaphore_take/ \ref mtb_ipc_semaphore_give).
 *
 * For queues, only one task/CPU may initialize ( \ref mtb_ipc_queue_init) a queue. Other tasks/CPUs
 * then
 * get the handle
 * ( \ref mtb_ipc_queue_get_handle) of the created queue. Use the get/put functions to take out or
 * put in
 * items to the queue
 * ( \ref mtb_ipc_queue_put, \ref mtb_ipc_queue_get).
 *
 * \section section_impl_ipc_semaphore_idx_valid_range Valid range for IPC semaphore number
 * mtb_ipc_semaphore_init function semaphore_num parameter valid range is from 0 to (including)
 * CY_IPC_SEMA_COUNT - 2
 *
 * \section section_impl_ipc_shared_data_objects
 * For all IPC library constructs, some data must be put in the shared memory regions
 * so that all cores can access. This must satisfy a few requirements:
 * - Memory should be accessible from all cores (e.g. CY_SECTION_SHAREDMEM macro can be used)
 * - If used with a core where Data Cache is enabled, memory should be aligned to
 * __SCB_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE
 * The following sections outline the different data types and their requirements.
 * \subsection section_impl_ipc_shared_data_ Shared data memory allocation
 * Shared data memory allocation can be done with help of MTB_IPC_SHARED_DATA_ALLOC macro, but
 * using it is not mandatory,
 * so user can allocate memory for the shared memory in any convenient for them way. This struct
 * is necessary to store and keep track of all shared objects during operation.
 * \subsection section_impl_ipc_semaphore_data Semaphore data memory allocation
 * semaphore data memory allocation can be done with help of MTB_IPC_SEMAPHORE_DATA_ALLOC macro, but
 * using it is not mandatory,
 * so user can allocate memory for the semaphore data in any convenient for them way as long as such
 * allocation satisfies next parameters:
 * - Memory should be able to store mtb_ipc_semaphore_data_t type struct
 * - Each initialized semaphore must have its own semaphore data object. These cannot be shared
 * between semaphores
 * \subsection section_impl_ipc_mbox_data Mailbox data memory allocation
 * Mailbox data memory allocation can be done with help of
 * MTB_IPC_MBOX_DATA_ALLOC macro, but using it is not mandatory,
 * so user can allocate memory for the mailbox data in any way convenient for them
 * as long as such allocation satisfies next parameters:
 * - Memory should be able to store mtb_ipc_mbox_data_t type struct
 * - Each initialized mailbox must have its own mailbox data object. These cannot be shared
 * between mailboxes
 * \subsection section_impl_ipc_queue_pool_memory Queue pool memory allocation
 * Queue pool memory allocation can be done with help of MTB_IPC_QUEUE_POOL_ALLOC macro, but using
 * it is not mandatory,
 * so user can allocate memory for the queue pool in any convenient for them way as long as such
 * allocation satisfies next parameters:
 * - Memory should be able to store NUM_ITEMS x ITEM_SIZE bytes, where NUM_ITEMS - number of max.
 * elements the queue can store, and
 * ITEM_SIZE - size of each queue item in bytes
 * - Each queue must have its own queue pool
 * \subsection section_impl_ipc_queue_data Queue data memory allocation
 * Queue data memory allocation can be done with help of MTB_IPC_QUEUE_DATA_ALLOC macro, but
 * using it is not mandatory,
 * so user can allocate memory for the queue data in any convenient for them way as long as such
 * allocation satisfies next parameters:
 * - Memory should be able to store mtb_ipc_queue_data_t type struct
 * - Each queue must have its own data object. These cannot be shared between queues.
 *
 * \section section_impl_ipc_preemtable_sema Preemtable Semaphore parameter
 * If preemptable is enabled (true), the user must ensure that there are
 * no deadlocks in the system, which can be caused by an interrupt that occurs
 * after the IPC channel is locked. Unless the user is ready to handle IPC
 * channel locks correctly at the application level, set preemptable to
 * false.
 *
 * \section section_impl_ipc_interrupts_priorities IPC interrupts implementation
 * In current IPC library implementation, each core has two of its "own" IPC INTR structures, which
 * services
 * all possible IPC library
 * channels. One IRQ structure is for semaphores, and the other for queues.
 *
 * \section section_impl_ipc_operation_isr IPC operations in ISR context
 * Callbacks may execute in an ISR context, so IPC queue put/get operations cannot be performed in
 * callbacks with a timeout != 0
 * Such operations will result in \ref MTB_IPC_RSLT_ERR_CANT_OPERATE_IN_ISR_W_TIMEOUT.
 * IPC semaphore take/give operations cannot be performed in ISR context with a timeout != 0.
 * Such operations will result in \ref MTB_IPC_RSLT_ERR_CANT_OPERATE_IN_ISR_W_TIMEOUT.
 *
 *
 * \section section_initialization IPC initialization
 * On some devices (currently, Traveo, XMC72, and PSE84 devices), startup code does not initialize
 * IPC PDL driver semaphores,
 * so it is done by mtb_ipc_init(). In general, the init function should be called by the first core
 * to boot.
 * Please see your device datasheet for details. This core will do the
 * initialization
 * and set up a pointer using an IPC channel so that all Cores can read and use the same variables.
 * if it has not already been done on that core.
 *  The corresponding mtb_ipc_get_handle will be used on  other cores to receive this data.
 *
 * \section section_impl_ipc_get_handle_before_init Calling *_get_handle APIs before _init APIs
 * Calling mtb_ipc_semaphore_get_handle() before mtb_ipc_semaphore_init()
 * will result in \ref MTB_IPC_RSLT_ERR_NO_SEMA_AVAILABLE. The correct way of using
 * mtb_ipc_semaphore_get_handle() is to call mtb_ipc_semaphore_init() before using
 * mtb_ipc_semaphore_get_handle(), and pass the same semaphore number that
 * was used for the initialization. Semaphores can be initialized on any core and accessed from
 * any core.
 *
 * Calling mtb_ipc_queue_get_handle() before mtb_ipc_queue_init() will result in
 * \ref MTB_IPC_RSLT_ERR_QUEUE_NOT_FOUND. The correct way of using
 * mtb_ipc_queue_get_handle() is to call mtb_ipc_queue_init() before using
 * mtb_ipc_queue_get_handle(), and pass the same channel and queue number that
 * was used for the queue initialization. Queues can be initialized on any core and accessed from
 * any core.
 *
 * Calling \ref mtb_ipc_mbox_sender_get_handle() before \ref mtb_ipc_mbox_receiver_init() will
 * result in
 * \ref MTB_IPC_RSLT_ERR_MBOX_NOT_FOUND. The correct way of using
 * \ref mtb_ipc_mbox_sender_get_handle() is to call it after \ref mtb_ipc_mbox_receiver_init() , and
 * pass the same mailbox index that
 * was used for the mailbox initialization. Mailboxes can be initialized on any core and accessed
 * from any core, however initialization must be done on the
 * receiving core for that individual mailbox.
 *
 * \section section_queue_data_protection To protect queue data and also ensure minimal possibility
 * of deadlocks,
 * any modification of the Queue besides its notifications must be done using the queue's semaphore.
 * To ensure less arbitration in ISR context,
 * notifications are instead protected by the lock on the channel the queue is part of.
